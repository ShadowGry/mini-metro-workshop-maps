## Cities
### Perth

Connect the suburbs of the world's most isolated capital city across the Swan River.

Includes 2 achievements:
- SmartRider: Deliver 500 passengers in Perth.
- JourneyPlanner: Deliver 1500 passengers in Perth using no loops.

## Installation
There are two ways of adding these cities to the game, by either subscribing to the Workshop Item on Steam (recommended), or by manually downloading this repository and placing the files in the game's `mod` folder. Both require at least version `release-44` of the game. The version can be found at the bottom of the game's credits.

### Steam
If you have purchased *Mini Metro* on Steam, the easiest way to install is by subscribing to the Workshop Item. To do so:
1. Go to this mod's Workshop Item page on Steam, [here](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2553077629).
2. Click "Subscribe".

This will automatically download and add Perth to the game when it is next launched. The global leaderboard is also accessible and Steam will automatically apply any future updates.

### Other Platforms
If you have not purchased *Mini Metro* on Steam, follow these steps instead.
1. Download the files by going to `Code > Download ZIP` and extract the files.
2. Copy the folder `Perth` to the following location, depending on your operating system:

The correct location can also be found in game, by clicking the folder icon in the bottom left corner of the Community Maps screen. Note that the `mod` folder does not appear until the game has been launched at least once.
